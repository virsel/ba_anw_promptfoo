indicative metric anomalies only appear in one pod.\r\nThe Code Bug root cause can either be a raised exception or an unexpected return. \r\n\r\nBy comparing logs, traces and metrics of an unhealthy system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.\r\nBased on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.\r\nThe result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.\r\n\r\nEach pattern comes with additional information.\r\nThese are the common attributes:\r\n- Deviation Score\r\n    Interpretation: \r\n        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0\r\n        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system) and one time the counterpart Trace instead appeared in the referenzed system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system)\r\n\r\nThis is the ranked result list with healthy system

indicative metric anomalies only appear in one pod.\r\nThe Code Bug root cause can either be a raised exception or an unexpected return. \r\n\r\nBy comparing logs, traces and metrics of an unhealthy system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.\r\nBased on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.\r\nThe result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.\r\n\r\nEach pattern comes with additional information.\r\nThese are the common attributes:\r\n- Deviation Score\r\n    Interpretation: \r\n        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0\r\n        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system) and one time the counterpart Trace instead appeared in the referenzed system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system)\r\n\r\nThis is the ranked result list with healthy system

system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.\r\nBased on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.\r\nThe result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.\r\n\r\nEach pattern comes with additional information.\r\nThese are the common attributes:\r\n- Deviation Score\r\n    Interpretation: \r\n        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0\r\n        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or

closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system) and one time the counterpart Trace instead appeared in the referenzed system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system)\r\n\r\nThis is the ranked result list with healthy system fokused and unhealthy system referenced (So Deviation of 1.0 means events appeared more often in healthy system): \r\nPattern on Rank 1:\r\nDeviation Score: 1.00 = a big anomaly.\r\nEvent Depth:

system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.\r\nBased on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.\r\nThe result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.\r\n\r\nEach pattern comes with additional information.\r\nThese are the common attributes:\r\n- Deviation Score\r\n    Interpretation: \r\n        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0\r\n        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system) and one time the counterpart Trace instead appeared in the referenzed system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system)\r\n\r\nThis is the ranked result list with healthy system

indicative metric anomalies only appear in one pod.\r\nThe Code Bug root cause can either be a raised exception or an unexpected return. \r\n\r\nBy comparing logs, traces and metrics of an unhealthy system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.\r\nBased on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.\r\nThe result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.\r\n\r\nEach pattern comes with additional information.\r\nThese are the common attributes:\r\n- Deviation Score\r\n    Interpretation: \r\n        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0\r\n        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system) and one time the counterpart Trace instead appeared in the referenzed system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system)\r\n\r\nThis is the ranked result list with healthy system

indicative metric anomalies only appear in one pod.\r\nThe Code Bug root cause can either be a raised exception or an unexpected return. \r\n\r\nBy comparing logs, traces and metrics of an unhealthy system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.\r\nBased on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.\r\nThe result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.\r\n\r\nEach pattern comes with additional information.\r\nThese are the common attributes:\r\n- Deviation Score\r\n    Interpretation: \r\n        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0\r\n        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or

indicative metric anomalies only appear in one pod.\r\nThe Code Bug root cause can either be a raised exception or an unexpected return. \r\n\r\nBy comparing logs, traces and metrics of an unhealthy system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.\r\nBased on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.\r\nThe result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.\r\n\r\nEach pattern comes with additional information.\r\nThese are the common attributes:\r\n- Deviation Score\r\n    Interpretation: \r\n        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0\r\n        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.\r\n- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace\r\n- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem\r\n- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events \r\n    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system) and one time the counterpart Trace instead appeared in the referenzed system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system)\r\n\r\nThis is the ranked result list with healthy system
