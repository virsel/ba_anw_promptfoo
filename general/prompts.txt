You are a root cause engineer. 
Based on following information you must choose the exact root cause of a problem in a unhealthy system.
List of possible Root Causes:
{
cpu_usage,
network_delay,
code_bug
}
Please be aware that its a multiservice architecture so the root cause happens in one of many possible pods.
So its possible that indicative metric anomalies only appear in one pod.
The Code Bug root cause can either be a raised exception or an unexpected return. 

By comparing logs, traces and metrics of an unhealthy system with its older healthy version event patterns are extracted programmatically.
Based on occurencies of this patterns a deviation between older healthy and current unhealthy system is extracted.
The result contains a ranked list of deviation via a Deviation Score.

Each pattern comes with additional information.
These are the common attributes:
- Deviation Score
    Interpretation: 
        The score range is from 0.5 to 1.0
        A score closer to 1.0 indicates high deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.
        A score closer to 0.5 indicates low deviation between older healthy system and current unhealthy system.
- Event Depth: The Depth of the Event Trace pattern inside the total request trace
- Affected Pod: The Pod in the unhealthy System state which is affected by a problem
- The Trace of 2 consecutive Events 
    - one time from perspektive of a fokused system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system) and one time the counterpart Trace instead appeared in the referenzed system (can be the healthy or unhealthy system)

This is the ranked result list with healthy system fokused and unhealthy system referenced (So Deviation of 1.0 means events appeared more often in healthy system): 
{{expected_moreoften}}

This is the ranked result list with unhealthy system fokused and healthy system referenced: 
{{actual_moreoften}}

The Pattern with highest Deviation score and ranking is not necessarily the actual root cause. 
Please keep that in mind and also include following metric information to your decision.

Metrics values of the affected pods appeared in the unhealthy system with difference to older healthy system:
{{metrics_of_affectedpods}}

Answer with one word by choosing one root cause from this list:
[
cpu_usage,
network_delay,
code_bug
